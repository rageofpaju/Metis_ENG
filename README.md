## ABSTRACT
You know there are times when you need to cook some food to feed yourself, you open up your refridgerator and see a bunch of ingredients lying around, but you just can't decide what to make.

Once I have assigned topics to the dataset using the previously-built NLP model from my previous project, I aimed to build a data pipeline, a simple web app, to suggest a possible dish that you can cook out of what you have.  

In a way, this is an extension of the NLP project, where I have built a topic model for a food.com recipe dataset (shorturl.at/jzCRY) to label each recipes with according topic.
